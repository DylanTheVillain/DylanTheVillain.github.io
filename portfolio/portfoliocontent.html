            WPA Outcomes Statement
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the Composition 2 class that I completed with Genine Perez, I was able to fulfill all of the requirements in the WPA Outcomes Statement.
            All of the assingments that I was given by Genine Perez required me to use all or some of the topics in the
            WPA Outcomes Statement.  The larger assingments required the use all of the areas in the WPA Outcomes Statement while the smaller
            assingments did not use all of the topics but emphasized other subjects that had not been covered in depth.  However, the processes topic
            in the WPA Outcomes Statement was not emphasized enough in our assingments.

            Composing in electronic environments.
        </h4>
        <p>
            All of the assingments in this class, except for the peer edits, were composed in electronic environments.  I used the Google Cloud
            storage infrastructure to store assingments and notes and used the Google Documents program to compose all of my assingments.
            For all of my assingments I use the Google Search Engine to conduct research for my paper.  This was especally important for the paper
            that I wrote on genetically modified crops.  That paper made extensive use of government websites and databases so that I could gather
            information for my paper.  The only use that I made for hardcopies was when I was doing peer edits and when I was turning assingments
            in to Genine Perez.

        <h4>
            Assingment 1: Essay on the evolution of an opinion.
        </h4>
        <p>
            The first assingment that we were given was a paper that was intended to document the evolution of my opinion on a particular topic.
            This assingment helped me achieve the WPA Outcomes Statement because it forced me to introspective that think critically about
            a specific topic.  To write this paper, I had to introduce the reader to a topic and keep their attention as I described what the
            paper was about and gave them a detailed narrative about my personal views on this topic.  This required me to be
            capable in rhetorical knowledge as well as critical thinking, reading, and writing.  Genine Perez also required me to use the MLA
            format, which required at least some knowledge of writing conventions.

        <h4>
            Assingments 3 and 4
        </h4>
        <p>
            Assingments 3 and 4 were important because they taught me more about conventions.  The purpose of assingments 3 and 4 was to use the
            fundamentals of a classical argument to begin to construct an argument.  In assingment 3 I had to learn how to create an enthymeme
            and warrant as well as figure out appropriate grounds, backing, and conditions of rebuttal.  This was espeically usefull in the
            development of my rhetorical knowledge because I had to learn how to construct and argument using a new technique.  Assingment 4
            required me to expand on assingment 3 by adding an entire thesis to my developing argument.  This of course required critical thinking
            as well as reading and writing skills because the construction of a thesis requires a skillful introduction to a topic ending with a
            compound-complex sentance that states you position and argument on the subject with no room for interpretation.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Assingment 7
        </h4>
        <p>
            Assingment 7 was the full paper that resulted from assingment 3 and 4.  Assingment 7 was more important for the development of process
            than the other assingments because this was a large project that went through two revisions and was peer edited by three people.  Unfortunately, I do
            not have the first draft.  To peer edit, I printed off three copies of the paper and had by classmates read and mark them.  I did the same
            to their papers.  Peer editing helps in the development of process but it also helps develop your critical thinking abilities and reading
            abilities.  It requires a fluent command of the english language and the ability to understand what the writer was attempting to say and how to
            imporove their paper.  This paper was also required me to use Knowledge of Conventions because I had to format the paper in MLA as well as
            structure the paper and sentance length so that it was not confusing or boring.

        <h4>
            Assingment 8
        </h4>
        <p>
            Assingment 8 was an intext visual argument.  Assingment 8 was useful in the development of rhetorical knowledge because I had to develop a
            different type of argument.  I had to find or create an image that had an argument "embedded" in it.  In this assingment I had to find an issue
            of opinion and find a way to communicate this issue or opinion to the largest possible number of people.  This required creativity and
            an understanding of globally understood symbols.  This assingment also required a knowledge of how to compose in electronic requirements as well as an ability to perform google 
            searches.  In this assingment I completed the written part on google docs and uploaded the selected image to the page.
