            In the Composition 2 class that I completed with Genine Perez, I was able to fulfill all of the requirements in the WPA Outcomes Statement.
            This is because each of the assingments that I was given by Genine Perez required me to use all or some of the topics in the
            WPA Outcomes Statement.  The larger assingments required the use all of the areas in the WPA Outcomes Statement while the smaller
            assingments did not use all of the topics but emphasized other subjects that had not been covered in depth.
