        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Dylan Johnson and I have crafted this website to act as my portfolio
        for my Composition 2 class with Genine Perez.  This portfolio will demonstrate that I have
        achieved all of the learning outcomes that were specified in the WPA outcomes statement.

    <h3>
        Site Navigation
    </h3>
    <p>
        To navigate the site, simply click on the buttons in the top left corner of the screen.
        One of the buttons will take you to my FYE blog, so be careful!  The button that says
        content will direct you to the actual meat of the portfolio; this is where I will
        argue that I have achieved the learning outcomes.  The assingments button will
        bring you to a page that has a series of links that will open a tab with a pdf of the
        appropriate assingment.  Clicking on the portfolio button will return you to this page.
        Because this page is javascripted, refreshing the page will return you to the base site
        with only two buttons.

    <h3>
        A warning

    <p>
        Clicking on certain sections of text a certain number of times might redirect you to a
        harmless but annoying website.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
