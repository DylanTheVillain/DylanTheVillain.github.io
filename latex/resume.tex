% Personal Projects
\begin{rSection}{Personal Projects (All hosted on github)}

% CodeBin
\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://github.com/dcjohnson/CodeBin}{CodeBin}}{}{}{}
	\item An online Python development environment.
	\item The backend was build using Python 3.4 and Django 1.7.
	\item The frontend uses Ace for the code editor and Skulpt for the Python interpreter.
	\item Currently the user can create new projects and access them with permalinks, fork projects, browse projects, edit and save projects, and make projects public or private.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Lisp Interpreters}{}{}{}
	\item I attempted to write a basic Lisp interpreter with no formal background in compilers. The result is quite buggy but I did learn a lot. If I have time, I try to give myself a more formal introduction to compilers. I will also have to write a compiler as part of my degree.
	\item {\href{https://github.com/dcjohnson/hackit}{First attempt}}

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Books}{}{}{}
	\item Started reading The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth. It is slow going because it is a very dense book; I also have to check it out from the library.
