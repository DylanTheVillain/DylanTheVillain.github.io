			Main Post

		<p>
			For this semester I hope to expand my social circle because I have a natural tendancy towards shyness. 
			I also hope to gain greater knowledge of computer systems, mathematics, and computer languages; this blog is a effort to advance that goal because I wrote the code for it and it is being hosted on GitHub.
			I also expect to get in better shape for this semester.  I wish to enhance my physical endurance through cycling and racquetball.  I also hope that racquetball will help improve my overall physical shape.
