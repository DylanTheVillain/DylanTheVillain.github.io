		<h5>
			The Presentation
		</h5>
		<p>
			I felt like I had an effective presentation overall.  There were some areas where some extra preperation would have helped however.  For example, some of the audience may have noticed a slight wavering in my voice at the beginning of my presentation; this is because I did not rehearse for my presentation at all.  This is also why I refered back to the computer more that I would have liked.  The obvious solution is for me to practice for my presentations more, but there is a deeper problem where if I don't think that the audience and the instructor are going to be very critical of my presentation I don't practice very much.  I think that the strengths of my presentation are the quality of my dictation after I got going as well as the asthetics of the power point itself.  I also feel that the best aspect of my presentation was that it was essentially a critique on the topic of "The Condor's" presentation; this made it both funny and informative.
