			A brief analysis of the World is Flat 3.0
		</h3>
		<h5>
			Presentation Style
		</h5>
		<p>
			Friedman was an interesting and engaging presenter however, he did have some issues.
			He repeated himself frequently and often took his time getting to the point he was trying to make.
			He also had some really bad metaphors but I guess that depends on who you talk to.
		</p>
		<h5>
			Content
		</h5>
		<p>
			His presentation was very detailed and he provided lots of information to support his main thesis.
			However, he did not provide enough detail about how this globalization occurred during his "The World is Flat 1.0."
			In these stages, it is likely that globalization occurred both with and without he home country even though home country sponsorship was very important.
			He did not mention the role of Joint-Stock companies during the colonization of the Americas or the role of individual merchants in establishing overland trade routes or Mediterannian trade routes.
		</p>
		<h5>
			Patents
		</h5>
		<p>
			I believe that there is one main area that he failed to cover.  He did not cover the role that patents could play in the development of his "Flat World."
			Many people believe that patents are necessary to garner creativity and protect ideas, but others believe that they are harmful because they prohibit the spread and implentation of ideas.
			He should have mentioned the impact they are having and if they should be changed.
		</p>
		<h5>
			Europe
		</h5>
		<p>
			He frequently commented on the greatness of American innovation but did not mention Europe at all.
			Many European contries also have more patent applications per capita than the United States.
			I believe that he should have mentioned how developments in Europe could impact the world as well.
		</p>
		<h5>
			The Green Revolution
		</h5>
		<p>
			This part really spoke to me. Basically he eloquently put together all of the different feelings I have had toward the Green Revlution.
			I think that he did well in mentioning how the "Green Revolution" is really just a load of crap and no real progress is being made.
			He stressed the point of needing to start are true Green Revolution because if we don't then the energy and climate crisis will destroy us.
			He defined a revolution as a fundamental change where people get hurt.  I can't think of any revolution where people didn't get hurt.
