            I did not learn anything extra from this visit because I already work there; but you knew that already.
            However, I did feel really special when I was the only one with access to the Lab.  I draw pleasure from the little things.
            The future applications of this technology are tremendous.  A basic example of an application would be generating 3D models of the human body that can be manipulated.
            This would provide surgons with a better visualization of the operation they are going to perform and could allow it to plan it out better.
            This technology has far more applications that range from 3D mapping of terrain for landscapeing firms to modeling the behavior of physical systems in 3D.
